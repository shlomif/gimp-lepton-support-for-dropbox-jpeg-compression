Introduction
------------

These are plug-ins for https://www.gimp.org/[GIMP] (versions 2.10.x and 2.99.x)
that provide partial
support for opening files that were compressed using Dropbox's open source
https://github.com/dropbox/lepton[compression of `*.jpeg` files called "lepton"]. They
wrap the `lepton` executable and GIMP's native JPEG support, and are written in Python
using the GIMP's Python API.
