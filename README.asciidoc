Introduction
------------

These are plug-ins for [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) (versions 2.10.x and 2.99.x)
that provide partial
support for opening files that were compressed using Dropbox's open source
[compression of `*.jpeg` files called "lepton"](https://github.com/dropbox/lepton). They
wrap the `lepton` executable and GIMP's native JPEG support, and are written in Python
using the GIMP's Python API.
